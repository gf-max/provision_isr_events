# Provision-ISR ONVIF Events & Camera Integration for Home Assistant

This is a **custom integration for Home Assistant** that provides support for **Provision-ISR NVRs and cameras** using the ONVIF protocol.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Event handling**  
  - Subscribes to ONVIF event streams (motion, alarms, channels).  
  - Creates `binary_sensor` entities in Home Assistant for each active channel.  

- **Camera support**  
  - Discovers ONVIF media profiles (via `GetProfiles`).  
  - Resolves RTSP stream URIs (`GetStreamUri`).  
  - Provides still images (snapshots) with full **Digest authentication** support and vendor-specific fallbacks.  
  - Creates one `camera` entity per channel/profile.  

- **Vendor fallbacks**  
  - Works with Provision-ISR native snapshot endpoints.  
  - Compatible with Dahua/Hikvision OEM snapshot URLs when channel mapping is known.  

- **Config Flow**  
  - Integration is configured directly from the UI (no YAML needed).  
  - Supports options for auto-off timers, channel selection, snapshot timeouts, etc.
